# Aircraft-Autopilot-Design

A comprehensive project on designing and simulating an autopilot system for the Boeing 747 (B747-FC3). This project features flight dynamics, control systems, numerical solutions, and performance validation using MATLAB and Simulink.

## Key Features

- **Flight Dynamics and Equations of Motion**
  - Comprehensive analysis of rigid body dynamics in 3D space.
  - Linearization and approximation of equations for control design.

- **Control System Design**
  - Longitudinal and lateral control systems for pitch, yaw, and roll stabilization.
  - Velocity and altitude control implementations.

- **Simulation and Validation**
  - MATLAB and Simulink models for visualizing control systems and dynamic behavior.
  - Step response, root locus, and Bode diagram analysis.

- **Realistic Flight Testing**
  - Integration with FlightGear for real-world flight simulation scenarios.
  - Validation of control system performance under varying flight conditions.

## Tools and Technologies

This project relies heavily on:

- **MATLAB and Simulink** for developing and simulating control systems.
- **FlightGear** for realistic 3D flight simulation and validation of designs.
